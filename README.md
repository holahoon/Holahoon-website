Still Working on README
Needs OG + SEO

(soon to be replaced with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/))

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

By running local environment, it builds a `.contentlayer` folder. This is [contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started-cddd76b7#1-setup-project) specific.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
