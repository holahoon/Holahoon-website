I was trying to make a navigation with an underline and animate it whenever the user is on a specific page. But, I didn't just want to make a boring underline and slide it from left of the navigation item to the right.
I wanted an animation where the underline starts from the very left of the whole navigation items and make it slide dynamically to wherever the navigation item is located.

There are a lot of tutorials on implementing this animation using Vanilla JS, but not many on React. Configured why not give it a shot and try to implement it on my own. But, I first need to have a better understanding of using `useRef` hook.

## Interacting with refs

Refs are mutable containers where we can theoretically store any arbitrary values. Most of the times, they are used to get access to a DOM node.

React sets the DOM node in the ref after it was rendered and sets it back to _null_ when the component unmounts.

### Focus an input with an effect

What if I want to focus an input element after the render? I could simply use `useEffect()` hook and focus on the element.

```tsx title="React"
const inputRef = React.useRef(null)
return <input ref={ref} defaultValue="Hey there" />

React.useEffect(() => {
  inputRef.current?.focus()
}, [])
```

I can have an empty dependency since I only want to run this effect only once after the component was mounted.
After the component was rendered and the effect runs, we can have access to the input element in the DOM and focus it.

Well, this is _not_ the best way. It has some caveats in certain advanced situations.

TkDodo describes as:

> Specifically, it assumes that the ref is "filled" when the effect runs. If it's not available, e.g. because you pass the ref to a custom component which will defer the rendering or only show the input after some other user interaction, the content of the ref will still be null when the effect runs and nothing will be focussed:

Here's code snippet from TkDodo's blog:

```tsx title="React"
function App() {
  const ref = React.useRef(null)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // üö® ref.current is always null when this runs
    ref.current?.focus()
  }, [])

  return <Form ref={ref} />
}

const Form = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const [show, setShow] = React.useState(false)

  return (
    <form>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setShow(true)}>
        show
      </button>
      // üßê ref is attached to the input, but it's conditionally rendered // so it
      won't be filled when the above effect runs
      {show && <input ref={ref} />}
    </form>
  )
})
```

When Form component renders, `input` is not rendered since it is set to `false` and _ref_ is still _null_.
Then effect runs, but it doesn't do anything. When `input` renders, _ref_ gets filled, but won't be focued since effect will not run again because effect isn't dependent on `show` state.

The effect will only run once the form component is mounted, not when the input element is rendered.
This is a problem.

## Callback Refs

Notice the [type declarations](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/fc9b16957473f81a1d708e6948b8d61e292aeb58/types/react/v17/index.d.ts#L85) of refs. Not only it accepts an object, but it also takes a function üôÉ

```typescript title="TypeScript"
type Ref<T> = RefCallback<T> | RefObject<T> | null
```

When passing a reference to a React element from `useRef()` hook, it's pretty much a syntatic sugar for:

```tsx {3} title="React"
<input
  ref={(node) => {
    ref.current = node
  }}
  defaultValue="Hey there"
/>
```

So, all ref props are nothing more than just a function and these functions run after rendering.

Well I guess I probably can just focus an input whenever it is rendered:

```tsx title="React"
<input
  ref={(node) => {
    node?.focus()
  }}
  defaultValue="Hello world"
/>
```

Well, this is fine... if I wanted to focus the input element everytime the component re-renders. I mean... probably not right?

## `useCallback` to the rescue!

Since React uses referential stability to check if the callback ref should run or not and it will skip if the same reference was passed in.
By using `useCallback`, we can prevent the function from being created everytime a component re-renders.

```tsx title="React"
const ref = React.useCallback((node) => {
  node?.focus()
}, [])

return <input ref={ref} defaultValue="Hey there" />
```

This is great! Since callback ref is bound to the DOM node, it will always work üòé

## My implementation

Here's how I created the sliding underline effect under the navigation menu items.

```tsx title="desktop-nav-item.tsx"
// (...)
const pathname = usePathname()
const [dimension, setDimension] = useState<{
  id: string
  width: number
  left: number
} | null>(null)

const measureRef = useCallback<(node: HTMLAnchorElement | null) => void>(
  (node) => {
    // extra logic...

    if (node) {
      const { id, offsetWidth: width, offsetLeft: left } = node
      if (pathname.includes(id)) setDimension({ id, width, left })
    }
  },
  [pathname]
)
return (
  {/* ... */}
  <Link ref={measureRef} href={link} id={link}>{label}</Link>
  {/* ... */}
)
```

The `measureRef` function will only be created whenever the `pathname` variable changes, and it will always have the value of the DOM node that it is referenced to. ü§ó
The function is really simple. It just takes the element and stores both the width and left position of that element.

That's it! Take a look at the navigation and try to navigate to a different page üòé
