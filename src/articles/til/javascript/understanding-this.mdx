Now that I am back in US, I need to refresh my memories and get ready for job interviews.

So basically the rule of `this` is actually rather simple. `this` is determined at the time a function is invoked by inspecting where it is called.

## Rules

### 1. With the `new` keyword

When calling the `new` keyword, `this` inside the function is a brand new object.

```JavaScript
function ConstructorExample() {
  console.log(this);
  this.value = 10;
  console.log(this);
}

new ConstructorExample();
// -> {}
// -> { value: 10 }
```

### 2. Using `apply`, `call` or `bind`

If `apply`, `call`, or `bind` are used to call a function, `this` inside the function is the object that is passed in as the argument.

```JavaScript
function fn() {
  console.log(this);
}

var obj = {
  value: 5
};

var boundFn = fn.bind(obj);
boundFn();     // -> { value: 5 }
fn.call(obj);  // -> { value: 5 }
fn.apply(obj); // -> { value: 5 }
```

### 3. When a function is called as a method

If a dot notation is used to invoke the function, `this` is the object that the function is a property of.

```JavaScript
var obj = {
  value: 5,
  printThis: function() {
      console.log(this);
  }
};

obj.printThis(); // -> { value: 5, printThis: ƒ }
```

### 4. Free function invocation

If a function is invoked without any conditions like above, `this` is the global object. In a browser, it's `window`.

```JavaScript
function fn() {
  console.log(this);
}

// If called in browser:
fn(); // -> Window {stop: ƒ, open: ƒ, alert: ƒ, ...}
```

when calling `fn()`, it’s interpreted as `window.fn()`, so this is `window`.

```
console.log(fn === window.fn); // -> true
```

### 4. When multiple rules apply

If multiple of the above rules apply, the rule that is higher wins and will set the this value.

### 5. ES5 arrow function

If a function is an ES5 arrow function, it ignores all the rules above and receives `this` value of its surrounding scopt **at the time it's created**.

```JavaScript
const obj = {
  value: 'abc',
  createArrowFn: function() {
      return () => console.log(this);
  }
};

const arrowFn = obj.createArrowFn();
arrowFn(); // -> { value: 'abc', createArrowFn: ƒ }
```

Going back to the 3rd rule, when we call `obj.createArrowFn()`, `this` inside `createArrowFn` will be `obj`, as we’re calling it with dot notation. `obj` therefore gets bound to `this` in `arrowFn`. If we were to create an arrow function in the global scope, this would be `window`.

### Order of precedence

When multiple rules apply, the rule higher on the list wins. So when rule 2 and rule 1 apply, rule 1 takes precedence.
