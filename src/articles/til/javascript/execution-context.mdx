There is a video on YouTube called [The Ultimate guide to Execution Contexts, Hoisting, Scopes and Closures in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt-qa_LlUH0) by Tyler Mcginnis. I personally found this video to be very simple and easy to understand the concept of Execution Context. It also explains about hoisting, scopes and closures. Though it'd be helpful for me to briefly summarize them.

## Context Execution

Whenever we run JavaScript code in the browser, the JavaScript engine (like Chrome's V8 engine) creates a special environment to handle JavaScript code. This enviornment is called the Execution Context.
There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:

- Global Execution Context (GEC)
- Function Execution Context (FEC)

### Global Execution Context (GEC)

## Hoisting

## Scopes

## Closures
