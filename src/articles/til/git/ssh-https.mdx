When I was configuring my bash terminal, it asked if I wanted to use SSH protocol to connect to Github repositories. Never used SSH protocol before, but wanted to try it without even knowing what SSH protocol is.

I was ready to push my code toe Github repository and it threw an error: _ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Operation timed out_.
I began to search what was wrong and I stumbled upon the SSH and HTTP in Git. So I figured it doesn't hurt to understand how these protocols work.

## Quick introduction to Git

Before diving in, let's first summarize what Git is. It's a [distributed version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control) that allows users to keep track of any file changes and manage it.
When working with a remote repository hosted on a Git hosting service like Github or Gitlab, a data transfer protocol is needed.
These protocols include **SSH** and **HTTP**. It pretty much works as a gateway from our machine to the remote hosting services.
Of course, there are other protocols Git uses, but I will only cover SSH and HTTP in this article.

Let's understand each of these protocols ðŸ¤”

## HTTP protocol in Git ecosystem

**Hyper Text Transfer Protocol** (HTTP) is the most common protocol used. In Git, you can authenticate with the remote repository using Github username and password.

After Git version 1.6.6, Git introduced a new, smarter protocol referred as "the **Smart** HTTP protocol". So there are two different HTTP protocols in Git: the Smart HTTP and the Dumb HTTP.
Eh, I won't talk too much about it, but here's the [reference](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols) if interested.

Basically, the beauty of using HTTP protocol is having a single URL for all types of access. Also, the server can just authenticate the user with a username and password rather than forcing the user to generate an SSH key.

Interestingly, the [Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols) describes that the Smart HTTP protocol operates similarly to the SSH, meaning it is secure.

## SSH protocol in Git ecosystem

**Secure Shell** (SSH) is a software package that enables secure system administration and file transfers over insecure networks.
The SSH protocol uses encryption to secure both client and the server. Anything that is transfered between two ends are encrypted to be protected from attacks in the network.

Earlier, I said that SSH requires the user to generate an SSH key. The server needs to decrypt whatever was sent from the client. In order to securely trust the client, the server needs the key that it generated to the client.

There's a tutorial on how to generate and set up SSH key, but I won't go into it in this article.

## Switching from SSH to HTTP

Choosing between the SSH or HTTP protocol really comes down to one's personal preference or security requirements.
For my case, there really isn't a reason to use SSH over HTTP since Git offers a Smart HTTP protocol that is pretty secure and easy to set up.

### Let's try to switch the protocol

#### 1. go into the desired repository

```bash title="bash"
$ cd dk/Desktop/...
```

#### 2. check the current list of remote repository url

```bash title="bash"
$ git remote -v
```

Since I was working on this blog website, the command spitted out as

```bash title="bash output"
origin git@github.com:holahoon/okdk.git (fetch)
origin git@github.com:holahoon/okdk.git (push)
```

Notice how the format is in `git@github.com:...` not `https://github.com/...`. This tells that I'm currently using the SSH protocol.
Obviously, I need to change the format to `https://github.com/...` to use the HTTP protocol.

#### 3. change remote url to use the HTTP protocol

Run the following command to changes

```bash title="bash"
$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/holahoon/okdk.git
```

Let's check the version and see if it changed the protocol.

```bash title="bash output"
origin https://github.com/holahoon/okdk.git (fetch)
origin https://github.com/holahoon/okdk.git (push)
```

It indeed changed the protocol to use HTTP ðŸŽ‰

Now that I can commit and push my changes to the repository, it will ask for my username and password.
Fyi, the support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Can no longer use my own password, but I need to use the generated personal access tokens.
